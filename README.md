# MyBlog
Followed  the well-known flasky project and created TwitterLikeBlog under the instructions of Corey Schafer( a experienced YouTube tutor), and I want this project successfully become my own first blog project , and online on server if possible, also customise the function I want to add in. let's see below:

- A page name feed flow, will present the chuangshiji news to the page 
- A page name square that all my classmates can login just using his/her name, no need password or email, just login using their name, and that's enough . Image sharing and memory refreshing will happen here. I am looking forward to see the site online, and that will be so much fun there.
- To place my music upon the website (need investigation here)
-
